Exercise 0 for CphBusiness, 3rd semester

This is an exercise in understanding [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and Java 8 lambdas.

## Testing and verifying code
The exercise can be verified against tests written by your teachers.

First, run the maven ``verify`` phase to upload your project to our server.

Second, find out your username as written in the Maven log (the last part of the URL). The default is your 
username on your Windows/Mac/Unix machine.

Third go to the server at [http://46.101.113.24:8080/](http://46.101.113.24:8080/){Your user name} where you insert
the user you found in step two.

## Reading the feedback
This will give you two columns: to the left are the tests which we have run on your code. Use these tests to
check that everything runs as you expect it. If it fails it means something is not working properly.

To the right are the result of a code analysis we did to test the quality of your code. Use this to 
improve how you write code. This is important! You will hate yourself if you go back to something you wrote
3 months back, but don't remember what it does.
